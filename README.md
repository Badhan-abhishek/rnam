# rnam

A small project to generate random user info for testing without any ads.

# Usage

Go to website and a user will be generate for you. Click on `Persist these values` button to save user info and to remove click on `Clear Persist Store` to remove user info.
Use `Reload` button to reload new user

> Note: It uses session storage, so if you want to persist multiple users then open the website in a new tab.

# Motivation

I was tired of using websites that generate fake user info and then have ads all over the place. I wanted to create a simple website that generates random user info without any ads.
